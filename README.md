# resize-all-images-in-folder
Use BASH to resize all images in a folder and convert them to webp format.

1. Copy & paster the resize_all_in_folder.sh script into the folder where you want to replace your images.
2. Adjust MAX_WIDTH, MAX_HEIGHT, MAX_SIZE, & WEBP_QUALITY to your desired outcome. You can run test runs as the script also creates a Back Up folder defined by BACKUP_DIR variable.
3. cd into the folder and run the `resize_all_in_folder.sh` script in your cli.
